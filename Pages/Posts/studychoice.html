                <h3>So... Why ICT?</h3>
                <p>Logic is fascinating. I mean, being able to explain all the stuff going around in the world
                    is just too big of a bargain to decline. From the smallest of organisms - looking at you
                    pesky <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, to the largest objects - like galaxies, and, perhaps 
                    even universes. And I have always set great store by it. And always will. But...
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">What does that have to do with my choice?</h4>
                <p>
                    Typically a logically oriented person would fancy science, moslty exact. For example,
                    creative people prefer to express themselves, because they can do it in their own way,
                    whereas a logical person would prefer to learn about the reason why something is/works
                    the way it does. And mathematics is the universal way - if something exists, it can be 
                    decoded by it. That is why maths is literally everywhere you look - it is the 
                    <b><i>Language of the universe</i></b>. Ok...
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">And how does it impact my choice?</h4>
                <p>
                    I have always admired math, and always aspired to using logic. And ICT has a lot of it.
                    But why not become a mathematician then? I introduce you to... <i>Problem Solving</i>!
                    Yes, maths  has a great deal of this, but usually the problems there are NOT present in
                    everyday life. I mean, where would you really use <b><i>limy→∞(1+1/y)y=e</i></b> ? That's
                    right - in very specific and impossible to grasp for most people problems.
                    Programming and Computer science, however, can be used <b><i>FOR EVERYTHING</i></b>!
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Wait, how?</h4>
                <p>
                    It's quite simple, actually. You can program anything, as far as you know what you are doing.
                    From basic calculators to entertaining games, programs are everywhere - just like math.
                    Even in the most basic of items - like a person's oven, for instance. And that is, along with logic
                    and problem solving, why I chose ICT. Not to mention that computers are becoming that much more of
                    a necessity in modern life, and having the ability to understand and command them is pretty <i>thrilling</i>
                    to me.
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">...Future?</h4>
                <p>
                    That said, what do i expect to have accomplished, and, to do after graduation? I expect 
                    to have learnt core programming concepts and the ability to use them. I hope i could 
                    get a job as a programmer and after graduating i will most likely work for a while 
                    before enrolling the masters.
