                <h3>So... How did it go?</h3>
                <p>The first 2 weeks of this program have been nothing short of amazing. First of all, I am 
                    going to say right here and now that there is A LOT MORE self-study than I anticipated. That is not
                    necessarily a bad thing, but it did take some time to fully understand and adapt to what was going on and
                    to what was waiting for us ahead. It caught me by surprise, but my <a href="/Pages/Posts/programmingexp.html"><i>programming experience</i></a>
                    definetely came in clutch, in regards to adaptation. Other than that I was pleased to see that everyone is
                    cooperatively oriented. But what about the...
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Study Environment:</h4>
                <p>
                    When enrolling this course I had pretty high expectations. I was absolutely astounded, however, and it is
                    really because of one thing: <b><i>THE TEACHERS!</i></b> Where do I begin... First of all, you should 
                    expect every class to be engaging. The teachers present the information with such passion that the only way
                    you could get bored is only if you have not slept for 2 nights straight. They also have wicked senses of
                    humor - be it sarcastic, dad-jokey or plain old dry humor, they have it all. And the main thing: these guys
                    are <b><i>literally</i></b> always there for you - all you have to do is approach them (insanely hard, right?)
                    and ask as many questions as you wish. They will be more than happy to help you. Sure, but what about the actual
                    <i>feedback</i> I received?
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Constructive Criticism:</h4>
                <p>
                    I was fortunate enough (top diff) to have received mostly positive feedback regarding this
                    project (again, I can thank my <a href="/Pages/Posts/programmingexp.html"><i>programming experience</i></a> for that).
                    Most of the criticism was funneled into miniscule things, like having forgotten to put ul items into a
                    li tag. Needless to say, they were correct about everything... almost(<b><i>in my opinion</i></b>). This is where is the key - 
                    you do not have to implement/change everything you are told. All it comes down to is, well, <b><i>you</i></b>.
                    That being said, the more feedback(criticism) you receive, the better, <i>especially</i> if it's from teachers.
                    It's valuable not only for becoming better, but also for understanding what is widely accepted as the norm.
                    How else would I have figured that loading <i>js</i> files with the onload attribute added to the body is bad practice?
                    (Thank you, Dan!). Ok, and what did <i>I</i> do with all that <b>feedback?</b>
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Reception:</h4>
                <p>
                    No, I did not chop it and turn it's skull into an item (looking at one specific yordle)... Instead, I took my time to understand
                    it and decide whether or not to implement it. First thing to note - <i>this is <b>not</b> to
                    offend you or shatter your ego, but rather to help you become better</i>. There is really no use
                    for someone with experience to sh*t on beginers (well, there is that thing called 
                    <b><i>League Of Legends...</i></b>). All they have in mind is your experience and knowledge growth, so keep
                    that in mind before you go full <i>Lethality...</i>
