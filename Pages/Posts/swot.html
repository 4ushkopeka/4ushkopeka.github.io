                <h3>So... What are they?</h3>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Strengths:</h4>
                <p>
                    Logic ramble ahead... It is perhaps the greatest strength I possess. Being able to use it 
                    practically, in a program/task, for example, as back-up in arguments and in studying. This 
                    is why I struggle in classes devoid of logic (Arts, language learning etc) and cannot understand
                    people who choose not to use it (certain groups of people pop-up immediately...).
                    Another strength that comes to mind is determination. The amount of times I have devoted to solving
                    a math problem/programming task are countless. Sometimes I go as far as ignoring bedtimes 
                    (sometimes till 5am!) and other human needs, like food. Those qualities definetely, in my opinion at least,
                    are going to come in handy in my current study! But not everything is perfect...
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">weaknesses:</h4>
                <p>
                    When it comes to weaknesses, most of them are personal traits that can be overcome, 
                    although I do fail at times. The first thing is the sweet tooth. Not only does it contribute to
                    weight gain, but also to selfishness. Another one is the procrastination. Usually it does not last,
                    as my determination kicks in, but sometimes leads to huge loss of time, which is often pivotal. And
                    lastly, lack of physical exercise. Despite enjoying sports, I find it hard to incorporate physical activity
                    in my life, albeit I do take the opportunities when they do present themselves. Which leads to...
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Opportunities:</h4>
                <p>
                    Apart from occasionally indulging in hobbies as a means of procrastination, there are 
                    seldom any significant chances available here. Even when such opportunities do arise, 
                    they typically revolve around gaming or socializing, with limited options for meeting 
                    new people. The situation is quite similar when it comes to satisfying one's sweet tooth. 
                    However, sports emerge as a notable prospect, offering not only a solution to combat a 
                    sedentary lifestyle but also a means of connecting with others and unleashing one's 
                    competitive spirit. Furthermore, logic and determination serve as valuable assets that 
                    can be applied effectively across various areas of life. Nevertheless, where there are 
                    positives, there are also downsides to consider.
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Threats:</h4>
                <p>
                    The biggest threat to my own study is, unironically, me. The only thing capable of spreading chaos and 
                    disorganisation - my own mind. My mental health has suffered immensely from a stupid brain malfunction,
                    commonly known as OCD. Thankfully, a solution has been found as is currently being enforced, so hopefully
                    this threat is gone for good. But what about the weaknesses?
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Combat Strategies:</h4>
                <p>
                    The elephant in the room has been addressed: OCD, and the solution. But what about my other weaknesses?
                    The sweet thooth can easily be shut down, as far as you are self-disciplined and limit your sugar intake.
                    Procrastination can be dealt with in a simillar way: giving yourself a small amount of time to deescalate
                    the pressure in your head. Just make sure to get back to work.
