                <h3>So... How did it all begin?</h3>
                <p>As stated in my <a href="/Pages/index.html">main page</a>, I adored logic since the beginning
                    of teenage life. Because of that I generall leaned towards maths, until one day my father was like
                    <q>Why don't you try that? It's the future, after all...</q> At first I was like <q>Um... why?</q> Then
                    his sarcasm joined the chat and he said Ð˜ should quit being such a <q>can</q>... It basically means I should be 
                    trying more things. And that just triggered me a bit and I agreed and <i>enrolled</i> a C# programming basics
                    course. 
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">First impressions</h4>
                <p>
                    It was pretty straight forward, actually. <i>I enjoyed it. I was good at it (hey, walter!).</i> Since the very begiinning
                    it became obvious to me that my father knows what he is doing(who would have known? Impossible!).
                    From then on I proceeded to enroll more and more courses, namely programming fundamentals and advanced.
                    I felt submerged in a world I could understand, command and use my problem solving skills(heaven, really!).
                    And it easily outclassed maths. I knew I had <b><i>found</i></b> my thing, my purpose. It was(is) smooth sailing after that.
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Diving deeper</h4>
                <p>
                    After the advanced course, I enrolled the databases one. I had mixed feelings regarding it, and can 
                    you really blame me for it? I mean, I imagined <b><i>excel tables...</i></b> and I was <b>not</b> amused.
                    However, I quickly came to the realisation that it was not really like that, just <i>partially</i>. I
                    was introduced to <b>SSMS</b>, which kind of resembles excel, but not really. It was again pretty 
                    logical with all it's shenanigans like keys, relations and functions(such as excel, really...). What made me enjoy it
                    was <i>actually</i> using it with code. I got to use it with EFCore, and was fabulous. 10/10 would do again.
                    After i enrolled a ASP.NET course, which included having a database and linking front-end with back-end.
                    I really, and I mean it, <b><i>really</i></b> enjoyed it. My creation(then abomiation...) can be found on my Github
                    under the TruckerProject repo. To check it out, you need ASP.NET, Visual Studio, SSMS and to change the database
                    path to your own. So, about results?
                </p>
                <h4 class="sub-question">Results</h4>
                <p>
                    I have acquired a certificate for each enrolled course. But that is the <i>unimportant</i> stuff. I got
                    <b>numerous</b> job offers from native companies and praise from the co-founder of <b>SoftUni</b> himself, 
                    <span style="text-decoration: 1px underline solid antiquewhite;">Svetlin Nakov</span>. He even presented me
                    with a job offer, which I had to decline since I had not yet graduated back then. With all that, I have to say
                    I am looking forward to this <i>new</i> adventure and can't <b>wait</b> to learn new things.
